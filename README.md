# upsAI: A Classifier for *Plasmodium falciparum* var Gene Upstream Groups

**upsAI** is a machine learning-based classifier that predicts the upstream group (upsA, upsB, upsC, or upsE) or localization (upsA, upsB subtelomeric, upsB/upsC internal, or upsE) of *Plasmodium falciparum* var genes from tag, cassette, exon 1, or entire var gene sequences. This tool enables accurate and rapid assignment of var genes to upstream groups, an important step for understanding the parasiteâ€™s role in disease severity and immune evasion.

## About

The *PfEMP1* family of proteins, encoded by the hypervariable **var** gene family in *Plasmodium falciparum*, plays a central role in antigenic variation and virulence. Var genes can be grouped by their upstream regions (upsA, upsB, upsC, upsE), with known links between these groups and disease outcomes.
To facilitate accurate and scalable categorization of var genes, **upsAI** uses machine learning models trained on k-mer representations of upstream sequences.
